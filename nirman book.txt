Slide 2. Salah

Salah is the second pillar of Islam. There are five daily prayers that a Muslim should pray daily. They are 

1. Fajr between dawn and sunrise
2. Zuhr begins at afternoon
3. Asr between mid-afternoon and sunset
4. Maghrib after sunset
5. Isha between night and dawn

If we do all five salahs, we will enter Jannah (Arabic word for Heaven) or else we will enter Jahannam (Arabic word for Hell). Fajr is the first salah in Salah. It exists between dawn and sunrise. Zuhr is the second salah in Salah. It begins at afternoon. After Zuhr, There comes Asr, which is the third salah in Salah. It exists between mid-afternoon and sunset. After Asr, there comes Maghrib, wich is the fourth salah in Salah. It begins after sunset. After Maghrib, There comes Isha, which is the fifth salah in Salah. It is between night and dawn.
